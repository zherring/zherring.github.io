  <aside>EchoUser | 2017 - 2018</aside>
  <h3 class="title">Manager, Sr Experience Designer</h3>
  <p>
    At EchoUser I had two primary responsibilities.</p>
  <p> First, I was the Design Lead on high-level partnerships with Ellie Mae, GE Global Research, and MuleSoft (amongst others). I lead project explorations, workshops and designed ML and AI-Assist software products. I lead internal and external teams in design sprints, research projects, and delivered final design deliverables for a variety of projects.</p>
  <p>
    Second, Organized internal design review and mentorship programs, as well as lead profession development and resourcing for a group of designers and researchers within EchoUser.
  </p>

  <p> Unfortunately, <em>most</em> of work I did is still under NDA. Happy to speak about the projects in broad terms, if you want to <a href="#contact">reach out</a>, though.

    <p>At Dell EMC, I was /the/  designer for two massive applications and a design framework utilized by the storage product divisions. Additionally, I provided consultations for two other design teams, designing user testing and research programs to EMC‚Äôs storage product development cycles.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Senior UX Designer</h3>
  <p>I was the Senior UX Designer at Sovrn, leading the design and research around their new publisher platform, /Meridian/. This was a massive effort involving tight coordination with  internal & external stakeholders to ensure we got the overhaul right.</p>
  <p>Before Meridian took over my work-life, I designed new features and on-boarding flows and designed some inter-office swag for fun. A few of these are linked below.</p>

  <aside>SurveyGizmo | 2011 - 2012</aside>
  <h3 class="title">UI Designer & Developer</h3>
  <p>SurveyGizmo is where I learned a lot about designing & developing for enterprise SaaS. I had done <em>some</em> UI design before, but this was where I sharpened those skills to a fine point and discovered all of the wonderful ins-and-outs of designing features for an existing customer-base.</p>
  <p>I think you can still find some of my my UFO-and-cow-tinged "Larsen" theme graphics/CSS in the code base if you really look.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Instructor</h3>
  <p>After 4 years of running my own freelance practice and two years before that of working at a local marketing and devshop, I was asked by the local Community College to teach design and tech classes.</p>
  <p>This was a blast and helped me really sharpen how I talked about design with students.</p>

<div class="col-small">
  <aside>Creative Rex | 2008 - 2011</aside>
  <h3 class="title">Owner & Operator</h3>
  <p>I did everything from coding WP themes, to designing custom interfaces for local development companies. I even wrote and drew a published comic series for web serial that was eventually licensed by Hulu. I learned a lot about client management and running projects running my own practice. I'm really thankful for the opportunity.</a>
