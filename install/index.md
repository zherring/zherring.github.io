I was asked to firm up the onboarding and installation screens with a couple of illustrations. After sketching for an hour or so, I realized this was the perfect opportunity to play with SVG animations (particularly the stroke-dashoffset technique Vox and Polygon popularized a few months back). It was only a half an afternoon of work to put a proof of concept on Codepen for engineering, but I was really happy with the end results.
